# Kubernetes Deployment Guide

This directory contains the Kubernetes (k8s) configuration files for deploying the application using the Kubernetes technology.

Initially created as a learning resource to understand Kubernetes, this directory has evolved to be managed through Helm later on.

Therefore, here the focus is on deploying the app in development mode only.
For enhancements such as production mode or application exposure, use the [Helm directory](https://github.com/mhornstein/DK-NLP/tree/main/deployment/helm).


## Docker Images

The Docker images used in these configurations are hosted on [my Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/u/maorh10).

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the application using Kubernetes, use the [K8s Dev Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/mhornstein/DK-NLP/blob/main/deployment/kubernetes/K8s%20Dev%20Cheat%20Sheet.md). It contains comprehensive instructions and personal notes on useful insights I've gathered.
